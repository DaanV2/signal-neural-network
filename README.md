# Signal Neural Network (SNN)

This is based around an idea I have, no idea if it already exists. but I did found the neural coding wiki article.

Our neural networks talks with signals, not numbers.
They seem to send certain signals in rhythmic patterns. They seem to combine and process these signals and output new signals.
